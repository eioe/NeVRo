## Code for the IEEEVR 2018 Paper (Klotzsche et al., 2018)       ##
###################################################################


This pipeline is archived for the sake of completeness. This is the code which was used to produce the results reported in Klotzsche (2018) [IEEEVR conference Poster/mini proceedings paper]. This code has been "deprecated" and is not maintained. 
As long as you do not just want to reproduce the results of this very poster/paper, you are better off with the newer NeVRo pipeline. It's (slightly) better code and preprocessing - and (way better!) documentation.
However, if you want to get this code to run, please go for it. If there are problems/unclarities (which is unfortunately very likely to be the case), do not hesitate to get in touch with me: klotzsche [at] cbs[.]mpg[.]de
It would have been better to write the code directly in a sustainable version, I know. But it was 2017 and I needed to finish my Masters and start my PhD. Bear with me. 
Once we decided to publish it, I decided it's better to start a new repo "from scratch" with the collaborators. So this one got neglected. 
Anyway, together we will also make this work. :)
